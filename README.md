### KNOWN ISSUES

---
- In order to view the generated .tcl file ('Create and view .tcl only' menu option), first associate the .tcl extension with your favorite text editor (e.g. Notepad, Notepad++ etc.).
- OpenSees does not combine constraints (multiple 'fix' commands on the same node). As a result:
   - Intersection joints that belong to two lines with different constraints should be handled separately.
   - Intersection lines that belong to two surfaces with different constraints should be handled separately.
- The horizontal information bar stays in front of GiD material/condition windows when the respective menu options are used; please use the toolbar buttons instead. However, there's no way at the moment to hide the information bar behind the GiD Layer and Copy windows.
